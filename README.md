Hello World. I'm Ozkan.
I live in Turkey.
I'm curious behind the scenes of blockchain. I am also working. I'm doing testnet in my spare time and trying to set up Node.
5 months ago I made my first attempt at testnets. and I've learned a lot so far
I've joined about 150 testnets so far. I've tested many different platforms and networks. If you want to improve yourself, you can try the node codes in my profile.
